### 3.1. Kindly share your motivation to participate to the Action Days of the Summit of the Future as well as how you will contribute to the group. (maximum 300 words)


Misinformation is turning into the biggest challenge of this decade, exacerbating issues of trust and authenticity online even ahead of the explosion of AI-generated content. At SimPPL, our goal is to empower the youth to counter these online harms. Our motivation is to improve access to opportunities, educational resources, and partnerships to create the platform to drive change sustainably.  I would like to attend the Action Days to share knowledge and resources with other organizations and learn from leaders in this space about how they navigated complex socio-technical challenges. I am happy to share more about how we cultivated a combination of academic and civil society partnerships to advance student research into the deployment of tools and products for nonprofits that can then benefit from it over a longer timescale and in a sustainable fashion.

### 3.2. Kindly share examples of how you have contributed to meaningful youth engagement through your work and initiatives at community, local, national, regional or international level. (maximum 300 words)

Media visibility and views of the work led by our student team members have crossed 100M+ interactions and featured on the front page of national newspapers.

### 3.5. Please specify if you would be interested in having a speaking role and if so, specify the topic of interest.

I would be interested in speaking about how to build an effective platform for elevating changemakers. I will draw on real stories of training students to get multiple awards from MIT, Google, Mozilla, Ph.D. offers from multiple top-tier universities, receiving funded collaboration offers from academics, and winning a clientele for their responsible AI products.
