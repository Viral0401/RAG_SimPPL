### Implementing Agency/Organization: Brief description of the implementing agency (max 100 words)

D.J. Sanghvi College of Engineering (DJSCE) is an autonomous educational institution running 3 PhD and 10 undergraduate programs in Mumbai, India. They are run by the Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal (SVKM), a charitable foundation administering a number of educational institutions pan-India, catering to hundreds of thousands of students annually including hosting Asia's fastest growing student festival.

### Summary/Abstract of the Initiative: Please provide a brief summary or abstract of your initiative (max 200 words).

SimPPL (https://simppl.org) is a US-based nonprofit research collective that offered a pilot responsible computing fellowships program in 2024. It is led by young researchers and professionals from India, working on rebuilding trust on the social internet. The responsible computing fellowships initiative implemented in India is housed at DJSCE and is based on (1) a 13-week ML course for 150+ Indian students from underserved backgrounds funded by Google India in 2021 (2) a pilot fellowships program in 2024 for 20+ senior undergraduates. The Fellowships program won prestigious grants from Google and Mozilla in 2023 and scaled to 130+ students at 15 educational institutes across the country (housed in Mumbai), achieving 8+ workshop papers accepted at 7 conferences (AAAI, NeurIPS, ICML, ICWSM, DGO) including 4 invited talks and 3 presentations at Stanford University. We have built 20+ partnerships with orgs. in 6 countries including national newsrooms (WNYC, Deutsche Welle), local factcheckers, non-governmental organizations winning international awards, and the United Nations.

### Relevance to Youth: please describe how youth are involved in the initiative. Please include details about their roles, contributions, and resulting outcomes.

SimPPL is entirely run by youth under 30 years of age and all our projects are led by senior and junior undergraduate students whom we mentor over the course of the first six months at the organization. Our members have pitched, partnered, conceptualized, and delivered international award-winning projects incubated at MIT, from the NYC Media Lab, Goethe Institut, and Wikimedia. Our work is funded by Google, Mozilla, Amazon, MIT, and others and featured in international outlets and on the front page of national newspapers, with over 100 million views. We have a robust training ecosystem that we are scaling nationally across the youth at underserved educational institutions.



### Impact Achieved: What impact has your initiative achieved so far? If available, please provide quantitative data and/or qualitative insights. (Attachments: In case you would like to share supporting documents, reports, and multimedia files related to your initiative, please send them to the contact information displayed in the end of the survey).

Will share slides to the contact information provided.
180,000 USD of awards and grant funding from Google, Mozilla, Wikimedia, MIT, the NYC Media Lab, Goethe Institut, Center for Tech and Society, and others.
100,000,000+ views of our content across India, USA, Germany, and Bangladesh including front page headlines in national newspapers.
8+ workshop papers and invited talks at reputed venues and universities (AAAI, ICML, NeurIPS, TrustCon, All Tech is Human, Stanford, MIT, IIT Madras, etc.)
Invited presentations at embassies and to governors from 4 countries (UK, USA, Switzerland, Finland), UNESCO World Press Freedom Day, World Bank, and UN Peacekeeping Operations.

### Utilization of Digital Technology: How and why is digital technology utilized in your initiative? (Please describe the technologies used and their applications). 


We rely on cutting edge analytics pipelines to collect, visualize, and analyse cross-platform social media datasets (https://arbiter-frontend.vercel.app/dashboard), partner with academics and civil society in order to conduct research into the spread of information and its influence (https://infolab.techglobalinstitute.com), and build consumer-facing systems including Generative AI Tools (https://sakhi.simppl.org) to deliver data insights to end users in an accessible language and through a user-friendly low-cost WhatsApp-based application. We provide media literacy trainings in Germany and India to advance AI literacy and awareness of deepfakes, in addition to teaching journalists how to employ GenAI in their work.

### Innovative Approach: How is your approach innovative? (Explain what makes your initiative unique and forward-thinking)

Our work improves information integrity through the monitoring, measurement, and mitigation of misinformation with our theory of change relying on educating the youth. To that end, we have created mentorship programs that are self-sustainable and supported by an active community of young researchers and mentors. Our award-winning model has reinvented how undergraduate students approach research projects, by inviting the partner orgs. to share real-world problems instead of creating artificial challenges to solve. Our work has increased social impact by multiple orders of magnitude as measured by the impact of the technology, research, grants, and media visibility achieved by student projects at a fraction of the cost compared to think tanks and professional associations with millions of dollars in funding and donations. Most importantly though, our work has motivated thousands of applicants to apply to limited internship positions with us and we are expanding program and resource access to encourage many of the talented applicants to explore opportunities beyond their classroom. Our programs empower changemakers to build local communities of students passionate about using responsible computing tools to drive social change.

### Partnerships and Collaborations: Who are the key stakeholders involved in your initiative? (e.g., government agencies, private sector, NGOs, communities)

We have partnered with organizations focused on information integrity with three pillars: information generation (newsrooms), policymaking (civil society and regulation), and education (training students). in India with: Aadhar Bahuddeshiya Sanstha, a nationally-awarded nonprofit supporting 100+ villages in Maharashtra; DigiSwasthya, a telemedicine provider with over 40,000 calls in the past 2 years. Both these nonprofits serve communities that include LGBTQIA folks, HIV-positive individuals, maternal and child care; in Bangladesh, we work with the Tech Global Institute, led by former leads for Meta in Bangladesh, and our work has been featured in the national news, discussed in parliament, and more; we worked with the NEST Center for Journalism (Mongolia), the only International Fact-checking Network verified fact checkers in the entire country; and Deutsche Welle (Germany) on multiple projects and panels on media literacy; New York Public Radio, Vermont Digger, and Yale Daily News in the USA; Times and the Sunday Times (UK); and we have also collaborated with the Center for Tech and Society, All Tech is Human, the Integrity Institute, and a number of other think tanks and nonprofits in Trust and Safety in the USA. Most recently we were invited to presentations and panels at the World Bank, UNESCO, and launched a partnership with the United Nations. Our Board Members lead the UK embassy in the USA, and we have consulted with a number of EU agencies on social media transparency regulation with our work featured by Axios. 



### Partnerships and Collaborations: In an ideal scenario, how do you hope your project will grow over the next 10 years to create new digital pathways for sustainable development in current and future generations?

We are partnering with Boston University, MIT, NYU, as well as a number of colleges within the Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal (SVKM) ecosystem which includes 40 different educational institutions as well as 22 pan-India colleges including those that are historically underserved and lack a comprehensive research infrastructure. We train students independently of their academic commitments and are a fully remote program by design (with optional in-person travel funded by our grants, for encouraging in-person collaboration). We have partnered in India with: Aadhar Bahuddeshiya Sanstha, a nationally-awarded nonprofit; DigiSwasthya, a telemedicine provider with over 40,000 calls in the past 2 years. Both these orgs. serve communities that include vulnerable populations, LGBTQIA folks, HIV-positive individuals, maternal and child care.
