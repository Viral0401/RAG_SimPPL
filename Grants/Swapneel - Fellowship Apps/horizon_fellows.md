# Please briefly share how the US election outcome would shape your overall interest in working on US emerging tech policy in 2025 and beyond, and/or your preferred track. 
# We realize elections can affect work experiences, especially in congressional offices and federal agencies, and plan to support fellows throughout this process.

I am for the most part agnostic to the US election outcome in working on technology policy because we have seem bipartisan agreement on some key issues including antitrust and regulation of monopolistic ambitions with particular focus on effective AI governance. Electoral priorities do affect funding and support for specific topics that the federal funding infrastructure is designed to advance, but there are enough areas of common support that underpin my motivation to work on emerging tech policy issues. To that end, I would be concerned about resources made available for measurement of online harms and that would lead to my participation to advocate for some specific areas that I believe might be underserved under a Republican Presidency. My experience consulting with think tanks, policymakers, regulators, and platforms in the US and EU underscore my interest in the AI track. I hold a Ph.D. in Data Science, conduct postdoctoral research in platform governance, and have published extensively at top AI conferences. I lead a nonprofit building responsible AI tools to advance information integrity. I drive impact using AI research to support policymaking, whether that is influencing the Oversight Board in delivering a new policy for Meta's governance, or helping the European Commission arrive at new metrics for algorithmic transparency as applied to very large online platforms.

I see myself leading my nonprofit, SimPPL, advancing global information integrity through our work on the identification, measurement, and mitigation of misinformation networks online. The upshot is we have a widespread presence in 6 countries and work with national newsrooms, nonprofits, Google, Mozilla, and others, but the con is limited short term impact compared to potentially working with policymakers in a direct capacity. The spotlight may shift away from AI governance and misinformation in a year, making it challenging to find the support we need to advance our work. I could become a faculty member at a business or information school focused on advancing technology and policy through a focus on digital interventions and measurement of their effects. It's a challenging process to get right in the short term but could be very lucrative to have tenure and focus on a diverse set of topics in the longer term. A third path is to work on AI policy full-time at a think tank or the government, where I would be well placed to drive change in regulatory outcomes


# If you did not receive this fellowship, what are 3 examples of other jobs or opportunities you might pursue in the near-term?
A one-sentence of explanation for each is sufficient. Bullet points are welcome.

I will continue my postdoctoral research focused on tech and policy or alternatively take on a full-time role to grow my nonprofit that advances information integrity globally. In some ways, this is still along the same lines as what I would do within the Horizon Fellowship, but in this case I would attempt to approach the same issues as an external partner to think tanks, policymakers, and civil society orgs. If neither of these end up being viable options, I'd likely fall back to a tech job at a social media company where I have the most past experience working on integrity and content distribution algorithms.



# Short essay response (max. 200 words): Horizon offers three fellowship tracks (think tanks, Congress, and the executive branch). Briefly describe why you are or are not interested in each of the three placement options. If you are unsure, you can explain why.
Bullet points are welcome. Please don't write more than 3-4 sentences per track.
For junior fellow applicants, who are only eligible for think tanks, please still write an explanation for why you're interested in think tank work.




# Short essay response (max. 200 words): Please give an example of one development in US federal government policy that happened this past year that you think is important. What happened, and why do you think this was important?
Please focus on a development within your technological area(s) of interest. We encourage you to include a couple of relevant background links (e.g. news articles or relevant websites).
