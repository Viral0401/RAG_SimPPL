# 100xImpact Script

I am a postdoctoral researcher at MIT and BU and cofounder at a nonprofit called SimPPL or simulate people. We have built a grassroots movement to advance digital trust for the global majority, by the global majority, supporting resilient governance within democracies.

I train students from underserved Tier II and III educational institutions in India to build and deploy responsible AI tools with civil society in order to deploy them across the world.

These students now train fact checkers in Mongolia to use technology to accelerate their fact-checking capacity to be an order of magnitude faster. They won an international award from Google News Initiative for such tech-enabled interventions. 

Through our program, teams of students working with former social media platform leaders published reporting that resulted in Meta's takedown of accounts promoting political targeting and harassment of female political leaders in Bangladesh, that had reached over 95M online users.

But tech isn't always easy to access in the global majority. To advance digital trust, the students work with global organizations to bring a diverse perspective into developing technology.

Last year, we sent some of them to local villages and they spent two days just talking to local healthcare workers. Within a year we have co-created digital literacy systems to sit within local healthcare infrastructure like our WhatsApp based health literacy intervention Sakhi, deployed with over 300 families in not only Jalgaon, India, but also Dhaka, Bangladesh, planning to reach 5000 families by mid 2025. MIT awarded and incubated this innovation and UNICEF is helping scale it.

Our responsible computing training program has been awarded twice by Google and once by Mozilla making it the only program of its kind to receive three such international awards in under two years. We have published over 15 research publications at top workshops in just the last year. News about our work has reached an audience of over 200 million and we are working with India's largest Hindi newsroom to cultivate digital trust nationally. 

My favorite one though is that my undergraduate mentee from India is now a technical mentor for my MBA student teams at MIT which shows the incredible capacity of this program to scale talent on a global stage.

Two weeks ago I was elected to represent the voices of my cohort in a presentation to Presidents Prime Ministers and leaders of developmental agencies about how to bridge the intergenerational divide and cultivate digital trust at an event called the Atlantic Dialogues. The Future Leaders program allows me to advance my contributions in global development and policy. I'm really excited to be able to continue scaling our work in these communities with international partners that I hope to appeal to using the platform this program provides.

We envision a world where communities are empowered to govern technology collectively, fostering resilient democracies. With your support, SimPPL can amplify its impact at this pivotal moment. Thank you.
