# OSV Fellowship Scholar Script


Actual Script is different pick it up from YouTube it's better: 

I am a postdoctoral researcher at MIT and BU and cofounder of SimPPL, a nonprofit advancing digital trust for the global majority. Weâ€™ve trained students from underserved institutions in India to build AI tools deployed in rural India, Bangladesh, and Mongolia, impacting hundreds of users. These students trained fact-checkers in Mongolia, earning recognition from the Google News Initiative, and exposed political targeting on Meta, leading to account takedowns affecting 95 million users.

Our innovations include Sakhi, a WhatsApp-based health literacy tool deployed to 300 families across India and Bangladesh, with plans to reach 5,000 by 2025. Supported by MIT and UNICEF, our responsible computing program has won three international awards from Google and Mozilla, published 15 research papers, and reached over 200 million people through media. I recently presented at the Atlantic Dialogues to global leaders and aim to scale these efforts further through the O-Shaughnessy Ventures Fellowship.
