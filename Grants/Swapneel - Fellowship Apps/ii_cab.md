Integrity Institute Community Advisory Board

Why is this the right opportunity for you at this time in your integrity career?

I'm a Board of Studies advisor at my alma mater in India, guiding educational efforts for their institute liaising with trustees and deans to set up their programs.  I enjoy interdisciplinary work solving cross-cutting problem that require multistakeholder participation. As an example I'm placed at the intersection of academia and industry allowing me to mentor students at SimPPL (https://simppl.org) as a nonprofit collective advancing impactful trust and safety research led by students.
