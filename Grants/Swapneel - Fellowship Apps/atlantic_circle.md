AI technologies can create highly convincing fake content, making it difficult for the public to discern truth from falsehood. This has led to what researchers call "truth decay," where the role of facts and analysis in public life diminishes. The proliferation of AI-generated content poses a threat to the integrity of information ecosystems, undermining democratic processes and public trust. I

Hi my name is Swapneel. I'm a researcher at MIT and BostonU studying free speech and platform governance. I grew up in the US and India with firsthand knowledge of the institutional challenges limiting the impact of K-12 and undergraduate education in training future leaders. Driven to change this, I've run programs training several hundred students in the past decade growing into a 200-member strong nonprofit with successful projects across 6 countries with over 20 university, newsroom, and nonprofit partners. We built and deployed systems to audit recommender systems at Oxford, tracked coordinated networks with UK-based newsrooms, detected state-backed threat actors with former US intelligence agency partners, identified gendered hate and harassment with Bangladeshi country leads for Meta, supported digital literacy in Germany and Mongolia with national newsrooms. We published papers at workshops at top workshops, received awards from MIT, Google, Mozilla, the NYC Media Lab, the Goethe Institut, the Center for Tech and Society, and been invited to panels and presentations at the UN, agencies, and embassies, to advise policymaking around AI.

Why are you applying to the ADEL program?

I am applying to this program to contribute a unique perspective working with grassroots organizations and to improve our abilities to empower students and involve them in tackling cross-sectoral problems. I'd love to learn from other leaders how they have grown international projects so that I am able to cater a better open ecosystem for change in the countries we work in.

How do you plan to contribute to and benefit from the ADEL program?




PLEASE PROVIDE A PERSONAL STATEMENT OF NO MORE THAN 250 WORDS PROVIDING YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF THE LEADERSHIP CHALLENGES OF TODAYâ€™S WORLD AND YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE WIDER ATLANTIC SPACE. *

The 21st century has provided youth with an arsenal of tools to elevate their voices, connect with others across the globe, and collaborate to promote initiatives they believe in. However, it is still challenging to overcome institutional barriers to drive changemaking at a global level--with a lack of mechanisms to take ideas into action. In my opinion, the next decade of progress is entirely dependent on our ability to empower the global youth to lead impactful initiatives deploying responsible technology and innovation. For example, my work aims to provide a platform to drive social impact through responsible innovation led by undergraduate students that we have trained over a year, such that they are able to connect with organizations, agencies, and policymakers across multiple countries and deploy initiatives driving real change at a grassroots level.  We need the youth because beyond advocating for change we need the young engineers, doctors, artists, and others across the Atlantic who are enthused to do the work underlying meaningful and sustainable change. It is through their lived experiences that they can scale the change they drive across communities. And it is of critical importance to provide free and equitable access to mentorship and training so that they are able to take their ideas and transform them into action. The Atlantic countries provide a microcosm of global culture and trends, as Brookings puts it, and our ability to elevate changemakers among the youth today will materially improve the quality of leaders we choose tomorrow.
